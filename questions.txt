The first stages of preprocessing are exactly the same as in the examples for tigre R package?

How are multiple probes for the same gene handled?
	I noticed that the GPLearn method in tigre package, treats multiple probes for a target gene as separate targets to fit and will not accept multiple probes for a TF. However, results in your paper seem to merge those into a single profile - can you explain how is that done? 

What were the training genes?
   The supplementary material lists the 25 training genes and a subset of the genes that were excluded from training due to high inferred adaptive variances. Is a full list of the 92 genes considered for training available? Further, is the list of their potential target/non-targets available?
   
How exactly did you implement the numerical integration via trapezoid rule? I am facing some tradeoffs in efficiency vs. numerical stability.
